the scriptable object holds defaults for the weapon type
and other data like possible data ranges for weapon variety
but keep the weapon type defined in a prefab

FORMAT
CONTROLLERS
The current heirarchy is good for quick editing and whatnot so we leave that be
player movement should probably stay in the player controller and weapon swapping should be moved there
or would it be better to hve both modify the player externally from the game controller object?
anyways, guns need a script nearly identical to the ranged weapon script
bullets need a script like the bulletmanager but it needs more info on host and target and more efficiency
USE UPDATE TO CAPTURE INPUT
